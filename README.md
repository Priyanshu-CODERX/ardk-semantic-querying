# üí° Semantic Querying with Lightship ARDK
Semantic segmentation is the process of assigning class labels to specific regions in an image. This richer understanding of the environment can unlock many creative AR features. For example: an AR pet could identify ground to run along, AR planets could fill the sky, the real-world ground could turn into AR lava, and more!

Semantic Querying helps to gather the data that has been predicted by ARDK by clicking on several areas of the world it might be a sky, ground, a person, food, etc.

üí°<b>NOTE:</b> Each pixel can have more than one class label, e.g. Artificial ground and Ground.

In ARDK, semantic predictions are served as a buffer of unsigned integers for each pixel of the depth map. Each of a pixel‚Äôs 32 bits correspond to a semantic class and is either enabled (value is 1) or disabled (value is 0) depending on whether a part of an object in that class is determined to exist at that pixel.
